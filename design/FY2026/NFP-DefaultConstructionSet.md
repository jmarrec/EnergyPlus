## Justification for New Feature ##

EnergyPlus currently requires a `Construction Name` to be explicitly specified on every heat transfer surface and subsurface. In many models, these fields repeat a much smaller set of construction assignments based on surface type and outside boundary condition.

This proposal provides an optional representation for reducing that repetition. Construction assignments may be defined by semantic category at Building or Space scope, while individual surfaces may retain explicit assignments as exceptions. For a scope containing *N* surfaces whose assignments reduce to *K* applicable categories, the shared assignments can be represented by approximately *K* construction references plus a scope reference instead of *N* repeated construction references.

Use of this representation is optional for each individual surface:

- An explicitly specified `Construction Name` is authoritative and retains the existing behavior.
- A blank `Construction Name` requests resolution through the surface's Space and then the Building.
- Defining or referencing a `DefaultConstructionSet` does not change any surface that has an explicit `Construction Name`.
- A model may mix explicit and inherited construction assignments.
- If a blank `Construction Name` cannot be resolved, the input is invalid and EnergyPlus terminates with an error.

This representation is not intended to replace explicit construction assignments or to be universally preferable. It trades some local explicitness for reduced repetition and centralized, scoped assignment. A surface with a blank field is not self contained. Users who prefer each surface assignment to remain directly visible can continue to use explicit `Construction Name` fields throughout the model.

## E-mail and Conference Call Conclusions ##

Pull request review identified improved schema alignment between OpenStudio and EnergyPlus and preservation of construction assignment intent during OpenStudio → EnergyPlus → OpenStudio round trips as project context that influenced the proposed object structure. A DOE request for improved schema alignment was also noted during review. These considerations are recorded here as context rather than presented as the native EnergyPlus justification for the feature; the justification above is the optional reduction of repeated construction assignments.

Review also raised whether a single unique construction set at the Building scope would be simpler and more consistent with the word "default." The proposed use of multiple named sets and assignment at the Space scope is addressed in the scope rationale below. The handling of contextual defaults and inherited values should be carefully considered during implementation, particularly with respect to established input processing conventions and input processing order.

## Overview ##

Three new IDD objects are added:

- **`DefaultConstructionSet`** — top-level object referenced by `Building` and/or `Space`. Groups references to `DefaultSurfaceConstructions`, `DefaultSubSurfaceConstructions`, and individual constructions for special cases (interior partitions, adiabatic surfaces).
- **`DefaultSurfaceConstructions`** — holds Floor, Wall, and Roof/Ceiling construction references for one category (exterior, interior, or ground-contact).
- **`DefaultSubSurfaceConstructions`** — holds construction references for each sub-surface type (fixed window, operable window, door, glass door, overhead door, skylight, tubular daylighting) for one category (exterior or interior).

Two existing objects are extended with an optional field:

- **`Building`** — gains `Default Construction Set Name`.
- **`Space`** — gains `Default Construction Set Name`.

The `Construction Name` field on `BuildingSurface:Detailed`, `FenestrationSurface:Detailed`, and `InternalMass` is made optional. If blank, construction is resolved at input processing time by searching Space → Building; if still unresolved, a fatal error is issued.

### Scope Rationale: Multiple Named Sets

A single unique set at the Building scope would reduce repeated construction references for a model with one uniform assignment policy. It would not represent scoped specialization without returning to explicit assignments on every affected surface. For example, a building may use one broadly applicable set while basement spaces use different exterior wall and ground contact constructions but inherit all remaining categories from the Building.

Multiple named `DefaultConstructionSet` objects allow a set to be reused by multiple Spaces and allow a Space to reference a partially populated set. Lookup is performed for the requested construction category. If the set at the Space scope does not supply that category, lookup continues to the set at the Building scope. The sets therefore do not act as competing global defaults. Each participates at an explicitly referenced scope with a defined priority.

This proposal intentionally limits the available scopes to Building and Space. It does not introduce additional inheritance scopes such as SpaceType or BuildingStory. Surfaces that require distinctions not represented by the selected categories or scopes, such as assignments based on orientation, may continue to use an explicit `Construction Name`.

## Approach ##

### IDD Changes

Add `DefaultConstructionSet`, `DefaultSurfaceConstructions`, and `DefaultSubSurfaceConstructions` objects (see **Input Description** for full IDD text).

Add an optional `Default Construction Set Name` field to `Building` (after the existing `Minimum Number of Warmup Days` field) and to `Space` (before the extensible `Tag` fields).

Remove `\required-field` from `Construction Name` (field A3) in `BuildingSurface:Detailed`, `FenestrationSurface:Detailed`, and `InternalMass`.

Extend `FenestrationSurface:Detailed`'s `Surface Type` field with four new `\key` values: `FixedWindow`, `OperableWindow`, `Skylight`, `OverheadDoor`. These allow users (and the OpenStudio ForwardTranslator) to express sub-surface intent more precisely, eliminating the current lossy collapse of FixedWindow/OperableWindow/Skylight → `Window` and OverheadDoor → `Door`.

### C++ Changes

**New `SurfaceClass` enum values** (`DataSurfaces.hh`):

Add `FixedWindow`, `OperableWindow`, `Skylight`, and `OverheadDoor` to the `SurfaceClass` enum before `Num`. The existing comment at line 151 already warns that downstream data in `ComputeNominalUwithConvCoeffs` (`DataHeatBalance.cc`) must be kept in sync.

**`OriginalClass` / `Class` remapping** (`SurfaceGeometry.cc` ~line 2469):

EnergyPlus already uses this pattern for `GlassDoor` and `TDD_Diffuser`: `OriginalClass` stores the IDD-declared type while `Class` is remapped for thermal calculations. Extend the existing loop with:

```cpp
if (surf.Class == SurfaceClass::FixedWindow || surf.Class == SurfaceClass::OperableWindow ||
    surf.Class == SurfaceClass::Skylight) {
    surf.Class = SurfaceClass::Window;
}
if (surf.Class == SurfaceClass::OverheadDoor) {
    surf.Class = SurfaceClass::Door;
}
```

**Downstream touch-points** — several places test `OriginalClass` against an explicit set of classes and must be extended to include the new types:

- `AirflowNetwork/Solver.cpp` — multiple checks for `OriginalClass == Window | Door | GlassDoor` that determine whether a sub-surface participates in airflow; the new types must be included.
- `HeatBalanceSurfaceManager.cc` line 1255 — counting logic that special-cases `GlassDoor` and `TDD_Diffuser` by `OriginalClass`; extend to handle new types.
- `OutputReports.cc` lines 651–660 and 950–959 — reporting blocks that enumerate `Window | GlassDoor | TDD_Dome | TDD_Diffuser` by `OriginalClass`; extend for new types.
- `DataHeatBalance.cc` — `ComputeNominalUwithConvCoeffs` per the existing enum comment.

All of these are additive `||` extensions to existing enum checks — no structural changes required.

**Reading new objects** (new function, likely in `SurfaceGeometry.cc` or a dedicated helper):

- Parse all `DefaultSurfaceConstructions` and `DefaultSubSurfaceConstructions` objects into structs.
- Parse all `DefaultConstructionSet` objects, resolving the nested object-list references.
- Read the new `Default Construction Set Name` field from `Building` and each `Space`.

**Construction resolution** (`GetHTSurfaceData` in `SurfaceGeometry.cc`):

For each `BuildingSurface:Detailed` or `FenestrationSurface:Detailed` with a blank `Construction Name`, apply the following resolution in priority order:

1. Hardcoded construction on the surface (existing behavior — unchanged).
2. `DefaultConstructionSet` on the surface's `Space` (if the Space has one).
3. `DefaultConstructionSet` on the `Building`.
4. If still unresolved → fatal error.

For paired surfaces, when both surfaces have an explicit `Construction Name`, existing EnergyPlus validation remains unchanged. When at least one construction is inherited, an explicit assignment takes precedence over a Space assignment, and a Space assignment takes precedence over a Building assignment. The construction with higher precedence governs the pair, and EnergyPlus finds or creates its reversed construction for the paired surface.

The lookup within a `DefaultConstructionSet` uses `surf.OriginalClass` (the IDD-declared type, set before the thermal remapping) and the outside boundary condition:

| `surf.OriginalClass` | Outside BC | Slot in `DefaultConstructionSet` |
|---|---|---|
| Wall / Floor / Roof | Outdoors | Exterior Surface Constructions → Wall/Floor/Roof slot |
| Wall / Floor / Roof | Surface / Zone / Space | Interior Surface Constructions → Wall/Floor/Roof slot |
| Wall / Floor / Roof | Ground* / Foundation | Ground Contact Surface Constructions → Wall/Floor/Roof slot |
| Wall / Floor / Roof | Adiabatic | Adiabatic Surface Construction (direct) |
| FixedWindow / OperableWindow / Skylight / GlassDoor / TDD_Dome / TDD_Diffuser | Exterior parent | Exterior SubSurface Constructions → matching slot |
| FixedWindow / OperableWindow / Skylight / GlassDoor / TDD_Dome / TDD_Diffuser | Interior parent | Interior SubSurface Constructions → matching slot |
| Door / OverheadDoor | Exterior parent | Exterior SubSurface Constructions → matching slot |
| Door / OverheadDoor | Interior parent | Interior SubSurface Constructions → matching slot |
| IntMass | — | Interior Partition Construction (direct) |

Note: `Ceiling` maps to `Roof` in EnergyPlus (`SurfaceGeometry.cc` line 3895–3897); `DefaultSurfaceConstructions` uses a `Roof Ceiling Construction Name` slot for both.

### Scope Limitations

Shading-related fields present in the OS IDD (`Space Shading Construction Name`, `Building Shading Construction Name`, `Site Shading Construction Name`) are **not** included in this initial implementation. These map to `ShadingProperty:Reflectance` objects in E+ and involve a more complex translation path.

`SpaceType` and `BuildingStory` inheritance levels from OS are not included (no E+ equivalent).

### Backward Compatibility

No existing behavior changes for models that hardcode `Construction Name` on every surface.

## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

New unit tests in `tst/EnergyPlus/unit/SurfaceGeometry.unit.cc` covering:

- Resolution via Building-level `DefaultConstructionSet` only.
- Resolution via Space-level `DefaultConstructionSet`, with Building-level fallback for unset slots.
- Space-level set overrides Building-level set for a specific surface type.
- Adiabatic and interior partition construction resolution.
- Paired surfaces retain existing validation when both constructions are explicit.
- Paired surface resolution when an explicit assignment takes precedence over an inherited assignment.
- Paired surface resolution when a Space assignment takes precedence over a Building assignment.
- Creation or reuse of a reversed construction for the paired surface when inherited assignments participate in resolution.
- Fatal error when construction cannot be resolved at any level.
- Surfaces with hardcoded `Construction Name` are unaffected by any `DefaultConstructionSet`.
- `FenestrationSurface:Detailed` with `Surface Type = FixedWindow / OperableWindow / Skylight / OverheadDoor` is parsed correctly, `OriginalClass` is set, and `Class` is remapped to `Window` / `Door` as appropriate.

A new shoebox example file (see below) will serve as an integration test via the regression suite.

## Input Output Reference Documentation ##

Add new sections to `doc/input-output-reference/src/overview/group-surface-construction-elements.tex` for `DefaultConstructionSet`, `DefaultSurfaceConstructions`, and `DefaultSubSurfaceConstructions`, placed after the existing `Construction` section.

Document the resolution priority (hardcoded → Space → Building), the mapping from surface type + boundary condition to slot, and the fatal error behavior.

Document the new optional `Default Construction Set Name` fields on `Building` and `Space`.

Update `BuildingSurface:Detailed`, `FenestrationSurface:Detailed`, and `InternalMass` field descriptions to note that `Construction Name` may now be blank when a `DefaultConstructionSet` is in effect.*

       \key OverheadDoor         ! new
```


## Outputs Description ##

No new time series output variables are added.

The existing Envelope Summary already reports the resolved Construction for each reported surface. To make inherited assignments auditable, it will be augmented with a Construction Assignment Source column whose values distinguish Explicit, Space, and Building assignments. No new report is introduced.

## Engineering Reference ##

No changes to the Engineering Reference are required. Construction resolution is a bookkeeping operation with no new physics.

## Example File and Transition Changes ##

A new shoebox example file will be added demonstrating:

- A `Building` with a `DefaultConstructionSet` covering all surface/sub-surface types.
- One `Space` with a partial `DefaultConstructionSet` that overrides only the Exterior and Ground-contact constructions for that space.
- The remaining spaces relying on the building-level set.
- At least one surface per category (exterior wall, interior wall, ground floor, adiabatic, exterior window, interior door).
- A few surfaces with hardcoded `Construction Name` to verify they are unaffected.

**Transition rules required:**

- **`Space`** — a new field (`Default Construction Set Name`) is inserted as A4, before the existing extensible `Tag` fields (which shift from A4/A5/A6 to A5/A6/A7). A transition rule must insert an empty string at position A4 to preserve existing tag values.
- **`Building`** — a new optional field (`Default Construction Set Name`) is appended as the last field (after `Minimum Number of Warmup Days`). No data change needed; existing IDFs simply omit it.
- **`BuildingSurface:Detailed`**, **`FenestrationSurface:Detailed`**, **`InternalMass`** — `Construction Name` changes from required to optional. No data change needed; existing IDFs with explicit constructions are unaffected.
- **`FenestrationSurface:Detailed` `Surface Type`** — four new keys added (`FixedWindow`, `OperableWindow`, `Skylight`, `OverheadDoor`). No data change needed; existing `Window` values remain valid and are treated as `FixedWindow` for `DefaultConstructionSet` resolution.
