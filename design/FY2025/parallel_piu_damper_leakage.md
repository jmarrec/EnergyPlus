## Justification for New Feature ##

- Parallel PIU can be perceived as more efficient than series PIU because they don't run as much
- Laboratory and in-situ study have shown that their performance can be impacted by backdraft damper air leakage
- EnergyPlus doesn’t have the capability to model parallel PIU damper leakage which could potentially provide misleading results when comparing designs with both types of air terminals

## E-mail and  Conference Call Conclusions ##

N/A

## Overview ##

With a new input, users will be able to simulate the impact of parallel PIU backdraft damper leakage. This approach will consider the two main impacts of air leakage through backdraft dampers: increased primary air flow rate and heat/mass transfer to the zone where the air leaks.

## Approach ##

Assumptions:
- Leakage only occurs when the terminal fan is off
- Leaked air is determined from the leakage fraction
- The damper leakage fraction is expressed as follows: `f_leak = m_dot_leakage / m_dot_primary`
- To meet zone loads, leakage results in an increase in primary air flow rate
- Leakage induces heat/mass transfer of primary air to the plenum or secondary thermal zone from which air is drew from when the fan is running

## Testing/Validation/Data Sources ##

- Simulation using sample files will be run and results will be compared against (Sardoueinasab et al., 2018)
- Unit tests will be added to verify that EnergyPlus takes leakage into account when requested by a user

## Input Output Reference Documentation ##

The following descriptions will be added to the Input Output Reference manual:

\paragraph{Field: Backdraft Damper Leakage Curve Name}\label{field-backdraft_damper_leakage_fraction_curve_name}

This field is used to indicate how the backdraft damper leakage fraction changes with different primary air flow fractions. The leakage fraction is defined as the ratio of leakage mass flow rate to primary air mass flow rate at a constant supply static pressure setpoint. This curve should describe the leakage fraction as a function of primary air flow fraction (ratio of primary flow fraction to maximum nominal primary air flow rate). For a static pressure setpoint of 62 Pa (0.25 in w.c) a resonable low leakage assumption could be around 3\%, a medium leakage value could be around 5\%, and relatively high leakage could be up to 12\%.

\subsection{Air Leakage in Parallel Fan-Powered Terminal Units}\label{parallel_piu_leakage}
As described in (O'Neal et al., 2016) and (Sardoueinasab et al., 2018), backdraft damper leakage in parallel fan-powered terminal units can be characterized using a leakage fraction at a constant static pressure setpoint:

\begin{equation}
{f_{leakage}} = \frac{\dot m_{leakage}}{\dot m_{primary}}
\end{equation}

Leakage is only simulated when the terminal fan is off. The impact of the simulated leakage is twofold:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To make up for the leaked air, the primary air flow rate should be increased to meet the zone load
    \item The air escaping from the terminal is affecting the plenum/the secondary thermal zone heat balance associated with the terminal
\end{enumerate}

The new primary flow rate is adjusted as follows:
\begin{equation}
{\dot m_{primary, adj}} = {\dot m_{primary}} \times \frac{1}{1 - {f_{leakage}}}
\end{equation}

The new primary flow rate won't exceed the maximum primary flow rate of the terminal.

Since leakage only occurs during dead-and and cooling operation (i.e., not during heating operation), the new primary air flow rate doesn't have an impact on the terminal mixer and heater. Leaks are accounted for after the terminal has been simulated, outlet nodes are updated then. The last step is to account for the thermal impact of the leakage on the plenum/secondary thermal zone. This is handled in a similar fashion as leakage simulation using the Simplified Duct Leakage Model, see \ref{implementation-000}.
